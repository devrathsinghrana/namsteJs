// // STARVATION of Callback Queue in JavaScript Event Loop
// // This demonstrates how synchronous blocking code can starve callbacks in the callback queue
// // starvation means that we are keeping th callstack busy with synchronous code so that the callbacks in the callback queue can't be executed
// // This can lead to delayed execution of callbacks, which is a common issue in JavaScript programming
