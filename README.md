## 🎯 Quick Revision Notes

### 🔑 **Key Takeaways:**

**Variable Environment & Scope:**
- Each function creates its own execution context with separate variable environment
- Local variables shadow global variables but don't modify them
- Call stack manages execution contexts in LIFO order
- Context destruction cleans up local variables automatically

**Undefined vs Not Defined:** ⭐ **NEW**
- **undefined**: Variable declared but not assigned a value
- **not defined**: Variable never declared (causes ReferenceError)
- **Memory**: undefined variables have memory allocated, not defined variables don't
- **Hoisting**: var declarations are hoisted and initialized with undefined

**Expected Output Patterns:**
```javascript
// Variable Environment & Scope:
// var x=1; a(); b(); console.log(x);
10   // from function a() - local x
100  // from function b() - local x  
1    // from global scope - original x unchanged

// Undefined vs Not Defined:
// console.log(a); var a=10; console.log(a); a="hello"; console.log(a); console.log(b);
undefined           // hoisted var before assignment
10                  // after assignment
"hello"             // after reassignment
ReferenceError: b is not defined  // never declared
```

**Memory Layouts:**
- **Scope**: Global: `x: 1, a: function, b: function` | Function a(): `x: 10` | Function b(): `x: 100`
- **Undefined**: Global: `a: undefined → 10 → "hello"` | `b: [NOT IN MEMORY]`

# Lexical Scope & Scope Chain in JavaScript

## What is Lexical Scope?

Lexical scope means that the scope of a variable is determined by its location within the source code. Functions are executed using the variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not when they are called.

**Example:**
```javascript
function outer() {
  var x = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // 10
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
```
Here, `inner` can access `x` because it is defined inside `outer`.

---

## What is Scope Chain?

When a variable is referenced, JavaScript looks for it in the current scope. If not found, it looks in the parent scope, and continues up the chain until it reaches the global scope. This series of scopes is called the scope chain.

---

## Example Demonstration

See `index.html` for a live demonstration.

```javascript
a();

function a() {
  var b = 23;
  c();
  function c() {
    console.log(b); // 23
  }
}

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

- `c()` can access `b` because it is lexically inside `a()`.
- `console.log(b)` outside `a()` throws an error because `b` is not in the global scope.

---

## Visual Representation

```
Global Scope
|
|-- a() Scope
    |
    |-- c() Scope
```

- `c()` can access variables in `a()` and global scope.
- Variables are not accessible upwards (from child to parent or global).

---

## How JavaScript Internally Works

1. **Global Execution Context** is created.
2. Functions are hoisted.
3. When `a()` is called, a new execution context for `a` is created.
4. `b` is created in `a`'s local scope.
5. `c()` is called, creating a new execution context for `c`.
6. Inside `c`, JS looks for `b`:
    - Not found in `c`, so it looks in `a` (finds `b`).
    - If not found in `a`, it would look in the global scope.
7. After `a()` finishes, `console.log(b)` tries to access `b` in the global scope, but `b` is not defined there, so a `ReferenceError` occurs.

---

## Try It Yourself

Open `lexicalScopeAndScopeChain.html` in your browser to see the code in action and observe the output.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Lexical scope** is determined by where functions and blocks are written.
- **Scope chain** is the process JS uses to resolve variable references.
- Accessing a variable outside its scope results in a `ReferenceError`.

# Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript

## What is the Temporal Dead Zone?

The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is the time between entering a scope and when a variable declared with `let` or `const` is initialized.  
Accessing the variable in this period results in a `ReferenceError`.

- `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized, so they are in the TDZ until their declaration is evaluated.
- `var` is hoisted and initialized as `undefined` immediately, so there is no TDZ for `var`.

---

## Example

```javascript
let a = 10;
const b = 100;
var c = 200;
console.log(a, b, c); // 10 100 200
```

If you try to access `a` or `b` before their declarations, you get a `ReferenceError`:

```javascript
console.log(a); // ReferenceError
let a = 10;
```

---

## Visualization

```
Scope Start
|
|-- TDZ for a and b (ReferenceError if accessed)
|
|-- let a = 10;   // TDZ for a ends
|-- const b = 100; // TDZ for b ends
|-- var c = 200;   // c is initialized as undefined at scope start
|
|-- console.log(a, b, c); // 10 100 200
```

---

## Try It Yourself

Open `temporal-dead-zone.html` in your browser to see the code and TDZ explanation in action.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **TDZ** applies to `let` and `const`, not `var`.
- Accessing a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration throws a `ReferenceError`.
- Always declare variables at the top of their scope to avoid
